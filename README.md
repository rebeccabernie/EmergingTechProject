This project is a web application that will recognise digits in images uploaded (or drawn) by a user. The project uses [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

### Project Outline
1. Create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images.  

2. Users can visit the web application through their browser and submit or draw an image containing a single digit.  

3. The web application will respond with what it thinks the user's digit is.
